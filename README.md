# BusPay

This project aims for the digitization of public bus transport by making an App for purchasing Realtime online bus ticket for buses nearby.

We saw the issues in current public transport digital payment system and possible solutions were drawn. then we implemented these solutions and made the android app

The entire project ecosystem consists of a conductor app and a passenger app. The conductor app is to monitor the location of busses and confirm the ticket purchase and the passenger app is able to detect nearby bus using GPS Location of conductor app to find busses in radius of 30m and then purchase Required tickets when you enter the bus.
